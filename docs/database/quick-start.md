# Quick Start




Clone the collection of [sample projects](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-samples):
```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-samples.git
```
and then open any of the projects in your IDE and play around making more molecules or add new attributes to the Data Model.

Use one of the sample projects as a starting point for your own project.
